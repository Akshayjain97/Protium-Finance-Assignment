# Protium Finance Assignment

Assignement for internship at Protium Finance :

The "Problem Statement.pdf" file consist of 3 questions that need to be answered for the 10 "*.xml" files.
I have provided Per file Solution in the "Solution_per_file.py" and "Solution_per_file.ipynb" file.

Try to run it on Jupyter notebook or anywhere else you want,
main thing is learning the Parsing of "*.xml" file using the inbuilt libraries like " xml.etree.ElementTree "other than that its just python code.
